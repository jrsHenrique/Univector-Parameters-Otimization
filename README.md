# ITAndroids Univector Control Optimization

This project consists of the changes made to the files in the ITAndroids VSS Repository, the robotics team of ITA, to optimize the Univector Control of the attackers using the AI technique of CMA-ES (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy) and a reward engineering process.

## Project Overview

The optimization process focuses on enhancing the performance of the Univector Control mechanism used by the attackers in the VSS (Very Small Size) robotics competition. By leveraging the AI technique of CMA-ES and a carefully designed reward engineering process, the attackers' decision-making capabilities and overall efficiency are significantly improved.
